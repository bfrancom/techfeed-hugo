Suse 10<br /><p>Testing out the new version of <a href="http://www.opensuse.org/">OpenSuSE</a>.  It is pretty good thus far.  I chose the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a> desktop since I don't normally run it.  I usually use <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a>.  </p><p><br />Anyway, it is nice and sleek.</p>
