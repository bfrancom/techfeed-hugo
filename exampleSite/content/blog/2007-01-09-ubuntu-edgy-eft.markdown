Jan 20 2007...Just wanted to update this.  The days I was trying to do this, the Ubuntu servers must've been overloaded.  I tried it again, and got everything up and running. Super deluxe-ified.....<br /><br /><br />Yes, I like Ubuntu.<br />No, Edgy Eft wouldn't install worth beans.<br /><br />I tried upgrading from Dapper,<br />But the download took more than 24 hrs.<br /><br />So I downloaded the alt ISO's for Edgy,<br />Then the install hung at 85%.<br /><br />DANG!
