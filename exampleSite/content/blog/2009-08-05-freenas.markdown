I was doing some research on some open source Network Attached Storage (NAS) utilities earlier this morning, and came across <a href="http://www.freenas.org">FreeNAS</a>.  It is based on FreeBSD, and has multiple protocols it can use for NAS like: FTP, iSCSI, CIFS, NFS, etc.<br /><br />See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeNAS">Wikipedia's entry</a> for more details.
