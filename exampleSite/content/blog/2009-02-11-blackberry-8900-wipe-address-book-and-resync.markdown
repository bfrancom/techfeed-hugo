In order to wipe it and repopulate from the server, go to the address book->options.  While on the contact options screen, hold down shift and type 'rset' without the quotes.  It will then prompt you to wipe the address book off the device, and repopulate from the server.  It may take up to 4 hours for the addresses to sync.
