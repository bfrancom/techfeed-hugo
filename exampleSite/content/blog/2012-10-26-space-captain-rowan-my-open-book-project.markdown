I was a graphic designer in a previous life, and still love to get the creative juices flowing. After reading many a bedtime story to my kids, I realized how morbidly lame most of them were. I thought I could come up with my own book that sucked a little less. One of my other passions in life is open source software. I thought I’d mix the two here, and come up with an open book project utilizing various open source tools that I’ve used, and maybe some that I haven’t.

The working title of my book is Space Captain Rowan which follows a young space cadet on his zany adventures!  This will be my little side hobby to keep my sanity in check.  I’ll post <a title="Concept Art" href="http://www.benfrancom.com/concept-art/">concept art</a>, and my progress, so stay tuned, and check out my blog section for updates!
