Well everyone, I saw the new Star Wars last night. Was it good you might ask? I would reply and say that it was good...but that is all, only good. It could have been so much better though.

You have an unlimited universe, with unlimited possibilities and you use the same exact plot from 2 of the original movies? Yet another Death Star.

Couldn't they think of something new? I was sorely disappointed that they relied; nay, totally copied the same plot.
