I always find it interesting to follow new advancements in technology.  Quantum computing is one such technology that will hopefully come to full fruition in my lifetime.

The article states, "Princeton University's Jason Petta has ...[demonstrated]...a method that alters the properties of a lone electron without disturbing the trillions of electrons in its immediate surroundings. The feat is essential to the development of future varieties of superfast computers with near-limitless capacities for data."
