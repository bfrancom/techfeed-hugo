Today, I discovered a new band that is surprisingly good. It's sort of like a cross between Rush, Black Sabbath, and David Bowie. The band is called [Amplifier](https://www.amplifierband.com/), and they have been around since '99, so it surprises me that I haven't heard of them before. I started listening to the album, ["The Octopus"](https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-octopus/1198303873) released in 2017, but they also have another record called ["Trippin' with Dr Faustus"](https://music.apple.com/us/album/trippin-with-dr-faustus/1235100150), released the same year???

## Oldie, but goody
Another band, or shall I say another record I am recommending comes from the band [Incubus](https://www.incubushq.com/). You may remember some of their top songs such as Drive, Pardon Me, or Stellar, but in my not-so-humble opinion, their best songs and best record, [S.C.I.E.N.C.E.](https://music.apple.com/us/album/s-c-i-e-n-c-e/283662040), was dropped in 1997. Their sound then was much more unique, and less pre-packaged-sounding, and very cool.

## Finally
Before I forget, I also wanted to mention a funkadelic-metal band who you probably have never heard of.  You have definitely heard of Metallica, but their current bass player, [Robert Trujillo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Trujillo), has been part of several bands. You probably have heard of one of the bands, Suicidal Tendencies, but not many have heard of [Infectious Grooves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_Grooves). They did a [cover](https://music.apple.com/us/album/immigrant-song/192757388?i=192757702) of Led Zeppelin's "Immigrant Song," and have some other cool tracks. Head on over and check 'em out, but watch out for "Cousin Randy!"

Enjoy!
