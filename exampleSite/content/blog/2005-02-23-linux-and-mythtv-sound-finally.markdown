I finally got sound working under <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MyhtTV</a> and my <a href="http://www.hauppauge.com/Pages/products/data_pvr250.html">PVR-250</a>.  It has been quite the process.  But I have learned some, so it was worth it.  Now I need to configure the wireless remote to worky.<br /><br /><br />Oh, BTW I am running Linux <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/">Fedora Core 3</a>
