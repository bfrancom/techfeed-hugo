I finally got the e-mail to fax gateway working.  Faxes come in from the world, then transferred into a pdf attachment and finally are e-mailed to the user of our choice.<br /><br />After hours of frustration this is what I had to do to get it working.<br /><ul><li>I uninstalled the default mail server, and installed "sendmail"</li><li>Installed Mimencode</li><li>re-ran faxsetup</li></ul><p>w00t!</p>
