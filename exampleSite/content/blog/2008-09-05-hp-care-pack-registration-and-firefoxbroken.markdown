I've tried to register a hardware care pack with HP, and it doesn't work in Firefox.  This is the error:<br /><br /><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;">error '80004005'</span> <p> <span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;">/csn/csnfw/system/sys_shell_functions.asp</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;">, line 1497</span><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>When in IE, it works just fine. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>In Chrome, it will load the page, but when you click the "show certificate link," it doesn't work.<br /></p>
