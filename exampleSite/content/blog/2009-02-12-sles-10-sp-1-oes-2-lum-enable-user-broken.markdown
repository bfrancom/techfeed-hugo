The preferred server should be a local server (in our case the same server) so as to not break LAN connections to NSS volumes if the WAN link goes down.  This means you need a replica of eDir on this server.<br /><br />After saving the file, restart namcd, and nscd.  Then do run namconfig cache_refresh. Finally, type in: <br />id admin<br />You should get a uid, gid, and some group names that admin belongs to.
