Maybe it's already available in one of the Linux desktops, but it would be cool if you could label your shell windows with a title of your choosing.  Something like, "Phoenix rsync started at 2006_03_02@15:00"<br />Then I'd be like, "oh yeah.. the ruddy thing failed. I got's to look at the problem."<br />Late.
