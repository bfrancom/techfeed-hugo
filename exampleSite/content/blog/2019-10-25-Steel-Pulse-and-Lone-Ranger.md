Today, I am dropping two recommendations, because I missed last Friday.

## Reggae
In my experience, most people who listen to reggae only really listen to a handful of bandsâ€”Bob Marley & The Wailers, and maybe one or two others.

### Steel Pulse
There is a ton of great reggae music out there, both old and new. One of my favorite bands and probably my all time favorite album across all genres is Steel Pulse's [Rastafari Centennial, Live in Paris](https://open.spotify.com/album/0DBU2QlxJuMujoxvydwrcd?autoplay=true&v=L). The brass (horns?) section really makes it stand out. The band lineup at the time of that recording must have had all the planets in alignment or something for it to sound so great.

Steel Pulse hails from Birmingham England, and have been around since 1975. Their old stuff is [freaking amazing](https://youtu.be/qaITQX3neiY). They have always had a ton of energy, with politically charged lyrics.

They even played at Bill Clinton's inauguration, and are still touring today. If you are lucky, you may be able to catch one of their shows.

The lead singer, David Hinds, has an amazing voice, and is a great performer. If you do an image search, you'll not believe [how big his dread locks](https://www.google.com/search?q=david+hinds+dreadlocks&safe=active&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjm_byr2LjlAhWLop4KHZAQDS8Q_AUIEigB&biw=958&bih=953) are.

### Lone Ranger
I heard of Lone Ranger off the local radio station during their reggae show back in the day. I'm not familiar with a lot of their other songs, but this one called [Apprentice Dentist](https://youtu.be/1b07Y0JiP-w) has always stuck with me. I hope you enjoy it too!

### End
There are a ton of other great reggae artists out there. Stay tuned for more in the future!
