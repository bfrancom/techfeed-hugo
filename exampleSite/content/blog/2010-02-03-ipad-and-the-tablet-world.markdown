Apple released their iPad which I hope takes off, and in turn helps the whole tablet market.  I can see people using these at home, in their local hangout, or on the road.

For those in design like graphic artists, mechanical designers, or architects, I believe a tablet would be ideal to take to clients.  They can show off their models, mock-ups, or schematics, without the kludginess of a laptop lid.  They could then zoom in on an area to show greater detail, and ensure the client is happy with what they are paying for.

Time will tell, and hopefully some more great tablet products come to market from other vendors to foster more innovation in the IT sector.
