Since my <a title="Space Captain Rowan: My Open Book Project" href="http://www.benfrancom.com/space-captain-rowan-my-open-book-project/" target="_blank">"Space Captain Rowan</a>" book is open source made with the open source software, <a title="Inkscape Home Page" href="http://www.inkscape.org" target="_blank">Inkscape</a>, I decided to move it over to <a title="Github; Space Captain Rowan" href="https://github.com/bfrancom/space-captain-rowan" target="_blank">github</a>. Â This actually makes it easier for me so I can work on it from my laptop remotely, or my desktop at home. Plus I get all the goodies (history/versions) that come with git.

I've added a few cells of artwork, and have cleaned up the directory structure.
