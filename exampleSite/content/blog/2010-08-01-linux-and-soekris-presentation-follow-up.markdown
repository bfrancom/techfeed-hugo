My presentation this past week on Soekris and Linux went pretty well. There were 9 of us there, and we stepped through an Ubuntu server installation. We had pizza, and Hans gave out some free Linux/FLOSS related goodies. There was some good discussion, and great questions. I installed Ubuntu on the device ahead of time, and showed everyone that it was running before we reinstalled as part of the presentation. Â It was a good thing too, since there was a problem with GRUB on the reinstall.
I want to thank everyone who came out, and made the meeting a success, and DeVry Phoenix for letting us use their classroom.
