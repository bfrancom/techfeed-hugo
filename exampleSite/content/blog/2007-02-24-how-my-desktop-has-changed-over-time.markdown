<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_kYEysMxY62I/ReC_cjmMVBI/AAAAAAAAABM/6gQj37OVuxw/s1600-h/Screenshot.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="/images/old/Screenshot.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5035234880712889362" border="0" /></a><br />I'll preface this by saying that I made some of the icons you see on the pic and stuff (the Nacho one, and the one just above him).  This is my home PC running Ubuntu Linux 6.10 Edgy Eft, Gnome desktop.  I was in the middle of cvsup'ing my FreeBSD router/firewall/proxy when this was taken.  I need to get a new vid card though.  Another monitor would be pretty deluxe and have it in dual head mode.  The other PC at home is a G4 running OS 10.28 that I rarely use.  My Laptop runs openSUSE Linux 10.1, Gnome, and compiz.<br /><br />I'll have to dig up an old screenshot from a previous post to compare now.
