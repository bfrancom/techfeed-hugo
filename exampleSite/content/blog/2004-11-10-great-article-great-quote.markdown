I was reading a nice article that is pro BSD.  See <a href="http://linux.oreilly.com/news/bsd_ss.pdf">here</a>.  <br />I found one of the funniest quotes in there:<br />
<br /><i>"Due to the nature of the business and
<br />financial constraints (one of my mentors
<br />once said that the top two OSI layers are
<br />politics and money) we often had to use
<br />a band-aid approach."</i>
