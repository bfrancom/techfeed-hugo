We use OES 2 Linux, with iPrint, and I couldn't get it working at first. I had followed some of the forum recommendations, and finally found the right driver/printername combination that got it working.<br /><br /><a href="http://downloads.canon.com/cpr/software/imagerunner/PCL5e-c_6_v8.35_v6.35_setup.exe">Click on this link</a> to download the driver I used. When uploading the driver to the driver store, select the PCL6 driver. It should show up as "Canon iR2022/2025/2030 PCL6." Do not select the PCL5e driver as it would not work for us.<br /><br />The gateway autoload command reads:<br />Code:<br /><br />iprintgw PORT=LPR HOSTADDRESS=x.x.x.x PRINTERNAME=pt1<br /><br />One thing to note: While logged into the Canon remote UI (via the IP of the copy machine), once the print job came in, it would give an "Out of Paper" error. The job would also be stuck in the job status window (still in the Canon remote UI). Once the PCL6 driver was installed, it went through.
