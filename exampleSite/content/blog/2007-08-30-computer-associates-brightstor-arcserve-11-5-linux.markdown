I couldn't find anywhere on the web that showed how to reset the CAROOT password for this version of ArcServe.  After speaking with customer service, just run:<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">/opt/CA/BrightStorARCserve/bin/cauth_setup</span><br />It will prompt you to change the password.<br />Done.
