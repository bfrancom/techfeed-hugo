I've been keeping my eyes peeled for project management tools for Linux, and this one caught my eye:<br /><br /><a href = "http://collabtive.o-dyn.de/" title = "Collabtive">  <img src = "/images/old/banner_collabtive_still01.jpg" alt = "collabtive" /></a> <br /><br />It is GPL, and I must say looks very slick.  They have a demo you can use to check out the features <a href="http://o-dyn.de/test/">here</a>.  I need to check into LDAP and e-mail linkages next.
