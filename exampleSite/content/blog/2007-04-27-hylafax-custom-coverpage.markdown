I had a dicken's of a time trying to come up with a good way to customize the Hylafax coverpage for our company.  I was able to get partially there from modifying some postscript.  But the comments section kept throwing me for a loop.  Then I finally found this link while browsing an ftp site:<br />ftp://ftp.sgi.com/sgi/fax/contrib/covers/jf-mycover.ps<br /><br />I was then able to use <a href="http://bourbon.usc.edu/tgif/download.html">TGIF</a> and plunk our logo and confidentiality notice in there.  It does take some tweaking.
