This is a quick one for today.

## Sugar Hill Gang
Avalanches came up as a recommendation I believe as I was listening to Sugar Hill Gang's "Rapper's Delight." I never realized that this song was pure disco with someone rapping over the top of it. Still a great classic though:

## Avalanches
I was pleasantly surprised by this Avalanches song, "Because I'm Me." Please watch it since the film adds a lot to the experience. It has the coolest kid ever in it! I wish I had his moves at that age.
