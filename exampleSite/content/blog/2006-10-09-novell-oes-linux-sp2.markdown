I did a minimal install of this NOS, and things went great.  When I went to add some Novell services it choked hard.  Not only did it have me rotate CD's like 3 billion times, it choked trying to install some basic NetWare files needed.<br />No problem, right?  Go to the forums and found the solution to the problem.  There are patches available, but when I go to download them, there is an error.<br />Try again later I guess.<br />Late!
