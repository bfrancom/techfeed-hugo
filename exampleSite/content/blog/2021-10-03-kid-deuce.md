Why are kids too nervous to poop at their own homes?

Have you ever wondered why kids are so nervous to poop at their own homes?

Maybe they get in trouble for:
* peeing everywhere around and on the toilet, but not actually in the toilet (sleepy kid totally missing)
* Using too much toilet paper
* clogging the toilet 🚽 

But then this begets more of the same problem since thy are too scared to go, they hold it in until they nearly explode releaseing a brown behemoth so huge, it could be in a horror film.

(Poo blob)

Mom scolding 
“Now Timmy, let me tell you how the green berets do it. They get one square of 5 grit sandpaper after they’ve done their duty, put their finger through the center and…..”
Kid Mortified 

“…and Timmy, if I catch you clogging the toilet one more time, I’ll make you unclog it with your bare hands 


Kid goes over to friends w limitless charmin 10 ply (zoomed image of 10 ply w bear 🐻) rainbows clouds and unicorns 

They unravel all the 🧻 they can find to create a nice bed to relax on…after an hour nap, they finally come to and everything flows freely.

Then they flush and never look back …just like how cool guys never look at explosions

Too awkward to tell the neighbor kid he can’t poop at your house: (poop nazi…standing by door of bathroom) “turn the fan on… only one square of tp 🧻.  Wash your hands for 33 1/3 min or else!

Too awkward to tell the kid “you can’t play here, your poops 💩 are far to mountainous and we know you’ve been saving it all up since the last  time

So they wait and hold it as long as they can, (running w funny face and legs)

Kid grows up to clog his own toilet etc. etc.
