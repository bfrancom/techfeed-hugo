They<br />say that they buy their software only<br />from very large companies and that<br />these companies will be around forever.<br />For these customers, I explain that I have<br />seen and often worked for very large<br />companies that no longer exist or are no<br />longer in the same line of business as<br />when I was acquainted with them, such<br />as Apollo, Wang, Data General, Digital<br />Equipment Corporation. Although it is<br />true that some of these companies were<br />bought by other companies (e.g., the recent<br />acquisition by Oracle of Sun Microsystems),<br />whether products and entire<br />product lines survived was the decision<br />of the purchasing company, not the customers<br />using the products.<br /><br />By purchasing closed-source technologies,<br />these customers lost control of their<br />software. In this day and age, that means<br />the customers have lost control of their<br />business or government."</blockquote><br /><br />-Jon "Maddog" Hall<br /><br />From:<br /><a href="http://www.linux-magazine.com/w3/issue/107/091-091_maddog.pdf">http://www.linux-magazine.com/w3/issue/107/091-091_maddog.pdf</a>
