Mplayer is my default media player, and I recently caught an episode of "Jericho."  CBS boasts that you can watch their full episodes online.  I have had the deuce of a time trying to get these to work.<br />To make a long story short:<br />1) download/install latest RealPlayer for Linux.<br />2) copy everything the newly created from codecs directory and plugins directory into /usr/lib/win32.<br /><br />Done.
