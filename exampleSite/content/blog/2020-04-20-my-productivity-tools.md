## Health is #1

For me, if I'm not healthy, I'm not productive. This means doing what I can to eat, exercise and sleep well. 

## Time management
For time management, and remembering breaks, I use the following:

* Cron Job to lock the screen (Mac or Linux)
* [Timeout app for Mac](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/time-out-break-reminders/id402592703?mt=12)
* [Pomodoro Tomato Timer](https://tomato-timer.com/)
* Blocking out news and social sites in `/etc/hosts` I have:

```
127.0.0.1       twitter.com instagram.com linkedin.com news.ycombinator.com 
```

## E-mail
* [Mutt](https://www.benfrancom.com/mutt-offline-with-mbsync/)
* Only responding to e-mail only twice a day
  * [https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2020/04/12/task-inflation-and-inbox-capture-on-unexpected-side-effects-of-enforced-telework/](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2020/04/12/task-inflation-and-inbox-capture-on-unexpected-side-effects-of-enforced-telework/)

## Music

I still love the Unix philosophy of a tool doing one thing well. In that spirit, rather than using iTunes or some other behemoth of a music application that is slow and bulky, on the desktop, I use the following:

I use [MPD](https://www.musicpd.org/) & [ncmppp](https://rybczak.net/ncmpcpp/) for local music, while for streaming music, I use [pianobar](https://github.com/PromyLOPh/pianobar). These are all great minimal tools that take some time to setup, but then you forget itâ€“Although they are difficult to live without once you are used to them.

These tools are very fast and keyboard/terminal centric. They are highly customizable, and work well. I like them a lot and have been using them for years.

### MPD

.mpdconf

```bash
music_directory         "~/Music/mpd"
playlist_directory              "~/.config/mpd/playlists"
db_file                 "~/.config/mpd/database"
pid_file                        "~/.config/mpd/pid"
state_file                      "~/.config/mpd/state"
sticker_file                    "~/.config/mpd/sticker.sql"
user                            "bf"
bind_to_address         "127.0.0.1"
log_level                       "verbose"
auto_update     "yes"
input {
        plugin "curl"
}
audio_output {
        type            "ao"
        name            "My Mac Device"
        mixer_type      "software"
}
```

### ncmpcpp

.ncmpcpp/config

```bash
allow_for_physical_item_deletion = "yes"
```

### pianobar

I setup controls from the keyboard like so:

~/.config/pianobar/config

```bash
history = 50
audio_quality = high
event_command = ~/.config/pianobar/pianobar-conky
```

.config/pianobar/pianobar-conky

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# create variables
while read L; do
        k="`echo "$L" | cut -d '=' -f 1`"
        v="`echo "$L" | cut -d '=' -f 2`"
        export "$k=$v"
done < <(grep -e '^\(title\|artist\|album\|stationName\|songStationName\|pRet\|pRetStr\|wRet\|wRetStr\|songDuration\|songPlayed\|rating\|coverArt\|stationCount\|station[0-9]*\)=' /dev/stdin) # don't overwrite $1...

case "$1" in
songstart)
#curl -s -4 -o ~/.config/pianobar/coverArt.jpg "$coverArt"
echo -n "$title"> ~/.config/pianobar/title
echo -n "$album" > ~/.config/pianobar/album
echo -n "$artist" > ~/.config/pianobar/artist

if [ "$(uname)" == "Darwin" ]; then
    # Do something under Mac OS X platform
    /usr/bin/osascript -e "display notification \"Title: $title\" with title \"Album: $album\" subtitle \"Artist: $artist\""
elif [ "$(expr substr $(uname -s) 1 5)" == "Linux" ]; then
    # Do something under GNU/Linux platform
    notify-send -i ~/.config/pianobar/coverArt.jpg "Pianobar - $stationName" "Now Playing: $artist - $title"
#elif [ "$(expr substr $(uname -s) 1 10)" == "MINGW32_NT" ]; then
#    # Do something under 32 bits Windows NT platform
#elif [ "$(expr substr $(uname -s) 1 10)" == "MINGW64_NT" ]; then
#    # Do something under 64 bits Windows NT platform
fi
#notify-send -i ~/.config/pianobar/coverArt.jpg "Pianobar - $stationName" "Now Playing: $artist - $title"
#/usr/bin/osascript -e "display notification \"Title: $title\" with title \"Album: $album\" subtitle \"Artist: $artist\""
;;

esac
