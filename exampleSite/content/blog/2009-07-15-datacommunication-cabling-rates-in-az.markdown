Just an informative post for anyone looking for rates on premise data/com cabling in the Phoenix area.  I just spoke to a highly trusted source, and in the valley, the rates are around $180 for a dual drop of voice and data.<br /><br />Also for the install and programming of a small PBX (4 handsets).  The labor would be about $500.
