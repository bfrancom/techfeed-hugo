From Eben Moglen:
<blockquote>I believe that Oracle sees clearly the nature of its business interests.  It knows that MySQL is much, much more valuable to it alive than dead.  In fact, Oracle has almost as much reason to improve MySQL as it has to  improve its flagship product. For a small firm, like MySQL AB,  dual-licensing revenue was the only efficient revenue source with which  to develop the product. But for Oracle, service revenue is much more  significant than dual-licensing royalties. As all parties who have  spoken about the merger agree, regardless of which side they are on,  enterprises that use Oracle are very likely to use MySQL also, because  MySQL is the world leader in number of installs. Which means that  companies that pay Oracle to service Oracle are very likely to pay  Oracle to service MySQL as well, if Oracle is not only servicing MySQL  but acting as primary funder and participant in a flourishing MySQL  ecology. Even if Oracle were only willing to invest in MySQL the extent  of its ability to increase the MySQL service business, Oracle would be  the best thing that ever ichappened to MySQL. In fact, Oracle has an  immense incentive to invest far <em>more</em> in MySQL than the extent  of its increased winnings in the MySQL service market. MySQL driven  technologically and economically by Oracle will be a price-zero full-GPL  missile aimed at Microsoft SQL Server.</blockquote>
