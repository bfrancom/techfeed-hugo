It is cleaner, and more customizable.<br /><br />...Plus, it's platform independent<br /><br />One thing that I would like to see in YajHFC, is a customizable user preference location.  When you run it from where you install it, it generates a preferences file.  When you run it from the printer redirect, it creates a new file in a different location.
