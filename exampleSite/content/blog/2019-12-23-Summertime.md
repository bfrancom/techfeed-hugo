My daughter has played this song a few times for me called, ["Doin' Time"](https://youtu.be/qolmz4FlnZ0) by Lana Del Rey. I had to explain to her that there is a better version, and that this was just a cover of Sublime's hit track below:

Little did I know the rabbit hole this would take me down. I found this amazing Jazz song I didn't know existed by Herbie (not John) Hancock and Jonie Mitchell:

It has Stevie Freaking Wonder on the Harmonicaâ€”How in the world am I just finding this?

Apparently the tune is from a Gershwin opera called "Porgy and Bess"...See more details on the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summertime_\(George_Gershwin_song\)) page.

You'll note on that page that there are over 25k recordings of the song "Summertime" including an oldie by Billie Holiday.

Christmas has come early my friends. Enjoy!
